# TeamMaker

Hello guys! I'm one of the founders of TeamMaker: a platform that analyzes user data and automatically groups people in the most suitable teams possible!

## What is TeamMaker?

This tool works for companies or events that got many people inside that need to be put in teams.
TeamMaker will auto sort these people in balanced teams based on professional data they provide, like skills and job experiences.

## Technologies

Our project is under development.
We're using the latest versions old NodeJS and ReactJS in our code, delivering high speed performance.
It is currently hosted on Heroku.

## Why would we?

This platform is being developed for the first brazilian online hackathon named **Open Hack**, held by **Shawee**.
Through the very first day of the contest, we noticed how hard it was to make a team online.
We would mainly present ourselves inside a dedicated Discord channel, and look for people tha have a similar skill set, and also professionals of different trades, trying to find balance in a 5 five member group.

## The problem was...

The channels were filled with presentations and chatting, and it was too hard to keep track of the conversation, and some time users would need to copy their just-now written biography to others, since there's no appropriate place to do that inside Discord.

It was tiring searching for people in a sidebar full of hundreds nicknames and pictures that wouldn't exaclty tell the contestant who they really are, or what they really do.

## What we hope for

TeamMaker is a response to that problem. The same platform that delivers the users sign up will also organize them by a score number based on their skills and the length of their professional experience. TeamMaker robot will calculate numbers and put the users on teams so that the total team score get balanced.

That way the event can auto avoid teams which have only developers inside, or teams that have only the most experienced professionals. And the system can be used not only in hackathons, but in any event that has hundreds of people working in different activities.
