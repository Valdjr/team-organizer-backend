# TeamMaker

Hello guys! I'm one of the founders of TeamMaker: a platform that analyzes user data and automatically groups people in the most suitable teams possible!

## What is TeamMaker?

This tool works for companies or events that got many people inside that need to be put in teams.
TeamMaker will auto sort these people in balanced teams based on professional data they provide, like skills and job experiences.

## Technologies

Our project is under development.
We're using the latest versions old NodeJS and ReactJS in our code, delivering high speed performance.
It is currently hosted on Heroku.

## Why would we?

This platform is being developed for the first brazilian online hackathon named **Open Hack**, held by **Shawee**.
Through the very first day of the contest, we noticed how hard it was to make a team online.
We would mainly present ourselves inside a dedicated Discord channel, and look for people tha have a similar skill set, and also professionals of different trades, trying to find balance in a 5 five member group.

## The problem was...

The channels were filled with presentations and chatting, and it was too hard to keep track of the conversation, and some time users would need to copy their just-now written biography to others, since there's no appropriate place to do that inside Discord.

It was tiring searching for people in a sidebar full of hundreds nicknames and pictures that wouldn't exaclty tell the contestant who they really are, or what they really do.

## What we hope for

TeamMaker is a response to that problem. The same platform that delivers the users sign up will also organize them by a score number based on their skills and the length of their professional experience. TeamMaker robot will calculate numbers and put the users on teams so that the total team score get balanced.

That way the event can auto avoid teams which have only developers inside, or teams that have only the most experienced professionals. And the system can be used not only in hackathons, but in any event that has hundreds of people working in different activities.

## What about P2P interaction?

Though our platform tries to save time and make the most out of the event, we also believe that manually picking who you want to be partner with can be _healthy_. Interacting with professionals you still don't know builds networking and you may end up learning new things, even if you never enter the other person team.

We want to add the manual team pick as a secondary feature, with a built in chat system. This way, the user could still opt to leave the auto team and find their own team mates, by chatting with them inside TeamMaker. TeamMaker would present user data in a much more organized screen, separated by their own skills. It will be easier to know who to talk to, invite someone to your team, oor get inside one in need!

## DEMO

We invite you to test our first feature, the Auto Team Sort! Your feedback is important to us!
